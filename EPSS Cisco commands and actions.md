# Common commands and actions for Cisco Network hardware in EPSS #

The first order of business is to outline the infrastructure in EPSS.

We have 5 Cisco catalyst 6500's of varying ages.

There are two in Slichter in the 5th floor closet, 3 in Geology(basement, 3rd floor, 5th floor library). The Slichter switches take care of most of the former IGPP offices ect, whereas the Geology switches cover all floors of the geology building.

There are also 3 cisco 4948 switches, 2 in the basement (telecom room and server room) and one in the 3rd floor closet.

The important note about these is that the 4948's understand cisco IOS whereas the older catalysts speak CatOS, the predecessor to ios.

IOS is significantly more google-able than CatOS, so this guide will focus on the CatOS commands initially
